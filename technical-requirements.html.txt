    <h1>Technical Requirements Document</h1>
    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <p>This document outlines the technical requirements for the Myra AI platform, a comprehensive solution designed to optimize load assignments, enhance communication, and provide real-time tracking and analytics in the trucking industry. The platform will be built using a microservices architecture to ensure scalability, flexibility, and ease of maintenance. It will leverage modern technologies and best practices to deliver a robust, user-friendly experience for all stakeholders.</p>

    <h2>Features from GitHub Repositories for Myra AI</h2>
    <p>Based on the analysis of various GitHub repositories, the following features have been identified for implementation in Myra AI:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>***Automated load assignment based on location, equipment type, and availability***</li>
        <li>***Real-time tracking and analytics for shipments***</li>
        <li>***Seamless communication between shippers, carriers, and truckers***</li>
        <li>***User-friendly interfaces for load posting, acceptance, and management***</li>
        <li>***Secure and efficient payment processing***</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Architecture</h2>
    <p>The Myra AI platform will be built using a microservices architecture, ensuring that each component is modular and can be developed, deployed, and scaled independently. This approach will enable us to deliver a flexible and scalable solution that can easily adapt to changing business requirements and technological advancements.</p>

    <h3>Backend</h3>
    <p>The backend will be developed using Node.js and Express.js, with TypeScript for type safety. We will use Supabase for the database, providing a scalable and secure data storage solution. The AI services will be implemented using Python and TensorFlow, leveraging advanced machine learning algorithms to optimize load assignments and provide real-time analytics. Integrations with third-party services, such as Trimble Maps for route planning and Twilio for in-app messaging, will enhance the platform's functionality and user experience.</p>

    <h3>Frontend</h3>
    <p>The frontend will be developed using Next.js with Tailwind CSS, providing a modern, responsive, and user-friendly interface. Shadcn UI will be used for UI components, ensuring consistency and ease of use across the platform. UploadThing will be integrated for secure and efficient file uploads.</p>

    <h3>Modules and Scalability</h3>
    <p>Each feature and component of the Myra AI platform will be developed as a modular, expandable block, ensuring that new features can be added and existing features can be updated without disrupting the overall system. This modular approach will also enable us to scale the platform efficiently, handling increased user load and data volume as the business grows.</p>
